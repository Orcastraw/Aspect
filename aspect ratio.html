	<h1>Console Tool for Streaming</h1>
        <div class="info">
        <p class="info" id="infoinfo"> This is Console Tool. Select a console or platform you want to learn about, and information will show up on the right.
        </p>
        <p class="info" id="PCinfo">
        PC games are flexible and typically can scale to whatever resolution you give them. However, standard sizing is 16;9, and should look like this.<img src="pcIMG.jpg"/>
        </p>
        <p class="info" id="XBinfo">
        All Xbox 360 and Xbox One games are in 16:9, and should look like this.<img src="xboxIMG.jpg"/>
        </p>
        <p class="info" id="WiiUinfo">
        All native WiiU games are 16:9, and should look like this.<img src="wiiuIMG.jpg"/>
        However for Virtual Console games, you should ignore the black bars and refer to the respective games column's for how to crop them.
        </p>
        <p class="info" id="PS4info">
        All PS3 and PS4 games are in 16:9, and should look like this.<img src="ps4IMG.jpg"/>
        However for PS1 games on PS3, you should refer to the Retro Games' column.
        </p>
        <p class="info" id="DSinfo">
        Both DS screens are in 4:3, and should look like this.<img src="dsIMG.jpg"/>
        Generally it's reccomended for DS games that when streamed, you have the top screen bigger than the bottom and have the bottom on the side.
        </p>
        <p class="info" id="tDSinfo">
        The 3DS' 2 screens are at different aspect ratios, with the top being a wider, 5:3 aspect ratio and the bottom being in 4:3. When streamed it should look like this.<img src="3dsIMG.png"/>
        </p>
        <p class="info" id="GBAinfo">
        GBA games are in the 3:2 aspect ratio, and should look like this.<img src="gbaIMG.png"/>
        However it's also acceptable to just use a 4:3 game layout when using a Gameboy Player.
        </p>
        <p class="info" id="GBCinfo">
        Gameboy and Gameboy Color games have a native resolution of 160x144, which loosely translated to 10:9, and should look like this.<img src="gbcIMG.jpg"/>
        </p>
        <p class="info" id="GCinfo">
        Most Gamecube games are in 4:3 and some support 16:9.<img src="gcIMG.png"/>
        However certain games have unique aspect ratios to be cautious of, such as Super Smash Bros Melee and The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.
        </p>
        <p class="info" id="Wiiinfo">
        Most Wii games support 4:3 AND 16:9. However some only support one or the other. To select an aspect ratio, simply select Widescreen or Standard in Wii System Settings for 16:9 and 4:3 respectively. <img src="wiiIMG.jpg"/>
        </p>
        <p class="info" id="PSPinfo">
        PSP games are in 30:17, which is 2 pixels short of 16:9. The difference is minor, and either one you use in layouts doesn't matter. 
        Your games should look like this.<img src="pspIMG.jpg"/>
        For streaming PS1 games off of a PSP, refer to the Retro Games' column. 
        </p>
        <p class="info" id="Retroinfo">
        Most retro games are 4:3, and should look like this.<img src="snesIMG.png"/>
